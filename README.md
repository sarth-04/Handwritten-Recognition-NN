## Overview
The `neural_network-checkpoint.ipynb` notebook covers the following topics:
- Data preprocessing
- Building a neural network model
- Training the model
- Evaluating the model's performance
- Saving and loading model checkpoints

## Installation
To run the notebook, you need to have the following software installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries (specified in the `requirements.txt`)

### Steps to set up the environment:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural_network-checkpoint.git
   cd neural_network-checkpoint
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open `neural_network-checkpoint.ipynb` in your browser.

## Usage
The notebook is structured in a sequential manner:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare your dataset for training.
2. **Model Building**: Define the architecture of your neural network.
3. **Training**: Train your neural network using the training data.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of your model using test data.
5. **Checkpointing**: Save and load model checkpoints.

## Notebook Details
### Data Preprocessing
- Loading data
- Normalization
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

Example code:
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load your dataset
data = np.load('your_dataset.npy')
labels = np.load('your_labels.npy')

# Normalize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Model Building
Define the neural network architecture using a framework like TensorFlow/Keras.

Example code:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout

# Define the model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Training
Compile and train your neural network using training data.

Example code:
```python
# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
```

### Evaluation
Evaluate the model on test data.

Example code:
```python
# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')
```

### Checkpointing
Save and load model checkpoints.

Example code:
```python
# Save the model
model.save('model_checkpoint.h5')

# Load the model
new_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('model_checkpoint.h5')
```
